Added ``type`` argument to ``attr.attr()`` and corresponding ``type`` attribute to ``attr.Attribute``.
This value can be inspected by third-party tools for type checking and serialization.
In Python 3.6 or higher, the value of ``attr.Attribute.type`` can also be set using variable type annotations (see `PEP 526 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/>`_).
